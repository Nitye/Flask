**Flask Framework based websites**
This repository contains the code base for several flask based websites.
The front end is quite basic for all of these.
Some of these have been directly copied from online sources to act as a template for more complex websites.
The main focus is the Alpha site which contains the merged/modified code from these templates for a site with login, socket connection and chatroom functionalities.
